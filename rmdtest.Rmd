```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

first I will load the packages and data

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
read.csv("plant.growth.rate.csv")
```

now its time to rename the dataset to make it easier

```{r}
pgr<- "plant.growth.rate"
```

now will be a good time to have a look at the data using some scatterplot

```{r}
