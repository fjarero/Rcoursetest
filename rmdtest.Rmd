```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

first I will load the packages and data

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
pgr <- read.csv("plant.growth.rate.csv")
```


now will be a good time to have a look at the data using some scatterplot

```{r}
ggplot(pgr, aes(x = soil.moisture.content, y = plant.growth.rate))+
  geom_point()
```
