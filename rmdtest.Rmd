knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
# Hello
# I completely forgot to add fancy headings

1. And 
1. maybe
1. a 
1. list
first I will load the packages and data

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
pgr <- read.csv("plant.growth.rate.csv")
```


now will be a good time to have a look at the data using some scatterplot

```{r}
ggplot(pgr, aes(x = soil.moisture.content, y = plant.growth.rate))+
  geom_point()
```

now that i have the graph, i can start plazing with colours, but i dont need to show the code anymore

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(pgr, aes(x = soil.moisture.content, y = plant.growth.rate))+
  geom_point( colour = "red")
```
